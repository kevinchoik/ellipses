# Ellipses
A quick-and-easy reminder app for sticky situations

### Introduction
We all have busy lives, and sometimes it's near impossible to keep track of everything we have to do. Even when time allows us to jot down notes, it may not be appropriate to pull out your phone in certain situations. With Ellipses, you can create a reminder in less than 5 seconds by creating a memorable pattern that you can go back to remind yourself what you missed. If you forget what the reminder was for, Ellipses will provide you with more context to help you track back into your day and figure out what you needed to do. Fill in the ellipses in your life, starting today.

# Features

### Silent night mode
The entire application is in night mode so that you can use it anytime, anywhere. Moreover, no component of this application makes any sound, so no need to be anxious while using Ellipses.

### Responsive sketches and playback
Ellipses captures every imaginable input you can think of, whether it be points, lines, or even multi-touch gestures. The playback is as smooth as the input since Ellipses stores when and where each point was registered, not the entire video feed.

### Automatic notifications
Ellipses sends you a notification automatically after a certain delay when you create sketches. You can adjust the delay or turn notifications off entirely in the settings menu.

### Google Calendar sync
Using Google's robust authentication system, you can sync Ellipses with Google Calendar. Once given the permission, Ellipses will retrieve every event that happened on any of your calendars while you were creating your sketch, and it will display them using graphs so that you can process the information in a blink of an eye.

### Additional features for the future
 * Different types of input by toggling certain animation in the settings menu
 * Smoother, more connected strokes for very fast dragging inputs
 * Toggling night mode UI (will still default to night)
 * Categorizing reminders into groups
 * Turning off the notification early for an individual reminder or setting another notification for the same reminder
